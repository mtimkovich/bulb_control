# Smart Lights

Code I wrote for managing the Wyze Color Bulbs in my home. My main goal is saving and loading the state of multiple lights (scenes).

Scenes are saved as JSON files containing the states of all lights. The ones for my home live in the `scenes/` directory.

There's also a Flask server and minimal web page to provide a rudimentary UI.
